# Financial-Project
This is a financial project with a demo dataset from Yahoo Finance, where I have used three company stock data sets from the years 2010â€“2023 to analyze their lag, difference, and returns.

Final Dataset (2010-2023) file contains final evaluated result.

Graph folder contains all the graphs related to trend, difference and returns.

Do. file contains all the steps to do this analysis.
